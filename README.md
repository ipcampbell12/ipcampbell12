### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on building a Flask REST API for a gradebook application I am developing. I'm almost done! After I've finished the backend, I plan on using React to develop the frontend. 

🧐 I'm learning Flask, React, data structures and algorithms, and version control with gituhb 

❓ Ask me about my previous projects. See some of the pins below!
